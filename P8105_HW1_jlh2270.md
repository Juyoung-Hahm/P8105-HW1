# Problem 1

Create a dataframe that consists: random sample of size 10 from a
standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether
elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length
10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”.

``` r
sample_df = tibble(
  sample_rnorm = rnorm(10),
  sample_logical = sample_rnorm > 0,
  sample_char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  sample_factor = factor(c("high","middle","low","high","middle","low","high",
                    "middle","low","middle"))
)
```

Here are the means of `sample_df`.

  - `sample_rnorm` mean is -0.3437516.
  - `sample_logical` mean is 0.3.
  - `sample_char` mean is NA.
  - `sample_factor` mean is NA.

We cannot find the mean of the character vector and factor vector.

``` r
as.numeric(sample_df$sample_logical)
as.numeric(sample_df$sample_char)
as.numeric(sample_df$sample_factor)
```

When applying the function `as.numeric` to the logical, character and
factor vector, we can see that logical and factor vectors turn into
numbers, but for the character vector, it still comes out as NA. With
this, we know that we canfind the mean of logical and factor vectors
using `as.numeric`.

Next, we are going to convert logical vector to other data types and
multiply the random sample by the result.

``` r
as.numeric(sample_df$sample_logical) * sample_df$sample_rnorm
as.factor(sample_df$sample_logical) * sample_df$sample_rnorm
as.numeric( as.factor(sample_df$sample_logical)) * sample_df$sample_rnorm
```

  - After converting the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the
    random sample by the result, we get:

0, 0, 0, 0.5181534, 0, 0.4200469, 0, 0, 0, 1.1979846

  - After converting the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the
    random sample by the result, we get:

NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA

  - After converting the logical vector to a factor and then convert the
    result to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result, we
    get:

\-0.1745287, -0.1886817, -0.7537604, 1.0363067, -0.6523041, 0.8400939,
-0.8294111, -1.3903905, -1.584624, 2.3959692

# Problem 2

Load the `penguins` dataset:

``` r
penguins = data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
penguins
```
